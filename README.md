# Agent-based-modelling-for-stock-market-simulation

This is a comprehensive analysis of the Trading Agent Simulation System, a sophisticated multi-agent framework designed to model stock market trading strategies. The system implements adaptive agents that compete within a realistic market environment using historical stock data from Yahoo Finance. Each agent employs multiple trading strategies and learns over time by adjusting strategy weights based on performance outcomes. The system offers valuable insights into trading algorithm effectiveness and the benefits of strategy diversification in financial markets.
